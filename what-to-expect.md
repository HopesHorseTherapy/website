## What to Expect

At Hope’s Horse Therapy, every session begins with a personalized assessment of your horse's needs...

**Bodywork is a powerful way to support your horse’s health and well-being. Using advanced Masterson Method modalities, each session is designed to release tension, increase range of motion, and help your horse feel and perform their best.**

During every session, I will work with your horse from nose to tail—addressing all areas of the body, as safely and effectively as your horse allows.*

**Before Your Appointment:** Please have your horse haltered and ready at the scheduled time. If they've rolled in mud, a quick brushing to remove the bulk of it is appreciated.

**Session Details:**
- Each session lasts approximately **60–90 minutes,** including time spent talking with you before and after.
 - The cost is **$75,** with sessions tailored to your horse’s unique needs.
- Regular sessions allow me to better understand and support your horse, focusing on known tension areas.
- A trip fee may apply depending on your location, and this will be clearly communicated when booking.


**Your Role During the Session:** 
While you're always welcome to stay nearby, I’ve found sessions are most effective when I can focus solely on the horse without human conversation. We’ll take a few minutes to talk before and after, but during the session, I kindly ask for quiet time with your horse.

**Ready to Get Started**
Contact me through a phone call, text, or email to book your first session. I'm excited to work with your horse and help them move freely and comfortably.


*We take the time to ensure each horse is comfortable, relaxed, and receiving the most benefit from their session. For safety, some areas may be address less directly based on your horse's training and comfort level. For example, if a horse cannot safely lift a hind leg, alternative techniques will be used..
