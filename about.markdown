Helping horses has been a lifelong dream of mine. While other kids imagined careers as astronauts or doctors, I dreamed of caring for horses—even though I grew up in the city with no access to them and little means to pursue that dream.

About 12 years ago, as my youngest child was preparing to leave for college, I found myself reflecting on what the next chapter of my life should look like. That’s when I remembered the dream I had as a little girl. I moved to the countryside, built a barn, and began the journey of learning everything I could about horses. I adopted my first two horses and opened my heart and home to a few foster horses as well. Giving these animals a safe, loving space where they were never without food, attention, or compassion quickly became my mission.

One of my adopted horses showed signs of chronic stress, and that’s when I discovered equine bodywork. The change in my horse after a few sessions was profound. When we moved and no longer had access to our therapist, I started searching for a way to help my horses myself. That’s when I found the Masterson Method®.

I began with a weekend course and started applying the techniques to my own horses. The results were undeniable—and I wanted to do more. I continued my training in advanced Masterson Method modalities in Tucson, Arizona, and am currently working toward full certification.

Although I’m still completing my certification, I’m excited and ready to begin helping your horse feel better—releasing tension, restoring balance, and honoring the unique needs of each individual animal. I would be honored to work with you and your horse on their healing journey.
